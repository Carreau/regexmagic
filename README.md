==========

A regular expression magic for the IPython Notebook that emulates some
of the capabilities of the interactive matcher at http://regexpal.com.

Usage:

    %%matchlines pattern
    text...
    text...
    text...

or:

    %matchfile filename pattern

Note: IPython presently interprets {x} to mean 'expand variable x', so
regular expressions like '\d{4}' must be written as '\d{{4}}'.  We're
working on it...
